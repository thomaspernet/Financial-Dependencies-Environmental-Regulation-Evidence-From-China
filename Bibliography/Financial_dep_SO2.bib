  abstract  = "[Banks play critical and active roles in sustainable development
               mainly because of their intermediary role in the allocation of
               capital for industrial expansion and development. The experience
               from Europe and North America has shown that a bank can be
               subjected to financial and reputation-related risks due to
               environmental and health damage caused by the operations of
               clients. Through environmental risk management and other
               proactive tools, the banking sector can drive improvements in
               environmental management in industry and drive a move towards
               investment in cleaner technologies. In China, commercial banks
               have recently started to acknowledge the risks and opportunities
               associated with environmentally sustainable development. There
               are clear indications of increasing pressures on banks to play a
               more proactive role in environmental issues. The major barriers
               are internal capacity and awareness in the banking institutions
               and lack of coordinated signals from regulators. Market drivers
               and global competition seem to create appropriate incentives for
               banks to reform.]",

              and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). SMEs form a large part of
              private sector in many developed and developing countries. While
              cross-country research sheds doubt on a causal link between SMEs
              and economic development, there is substantial evidence that
              small firms face larger growth constraints and have less access
              to formal sources of external finance, potentially explaining the
              lack of SMEs' contribution to growth. Financial and institutional
              development helps alleviate SMEs' growth constraints and increase
              their access to external finance and thus levels the playing
              field between firms of different sizes. Specific financing tools
              such as leasing and factoring can be useful in facilitating
              greater access to finance even in the absence of well-developed

                 standards; optimizing and upgrading of industrial structure;
                 increasing energy efficiency; coordinating urban and rural

                 severe storms, winter and the massive earthquake in
                 Sichuan-took a heavy toll. Externally, global demand has

               differences in states' industrial compositions, an acknowledged

  abstract  = "The pollution haven hypothesis refers to the possibility that
               multinational firms, particularly those engaged in highly
               polluting activities, relocate to countries with weaker
               environmental standards. Despite the plausibility and popularity
               of this hypothesis, the existing literature has found only
               limited evidence to support it. To enhance our ability to detect
               the possible dirty secret, this study makes improvements in four
               areas. First, we focus on investment flows from multiple
               countries to 25 economies in Eastern Europe and the former
               Soviet Union. Transition countries are a suitable region for
               studying this question, as they offer a large variation in terms
               of environmental standards. Second, we take into explicit
               account the effect of host country corruption. Third, we include
               information on both the polluting-intensity of the potential
               investor and the environmental stringency in the potential host
               country, which allows us to test whether dirty industries are
               relatively more attracted to locations with weak standards. And
               fourth, we rely on firm-level rather than industry-level data.
               Despite these improvements, we find no support for the pollution
               haven hypothesis. If anything, firms in less polluting
               industries are more likely to invest in the region. We find no
               systematic evidence that FDI from dirtier industries is more

              rapid economic growth, China implemented a mandatory emissions
              control system since the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) period, and
              the emission reduction targets have been met and even exceeded.
              This article explores how China achieved its emissions reduction
              targets by systematically identifying the main emission reduction
              pathways, including both the environmental and economic factors,
              and evaluates the contribution of each factor using structure
              decomposition analysis. A study of the two key controlled
              pollutants, industrial sulfur dioxide (SO2) and chemical oxygen
              demand (COD), during the 11th FYP period showed that (i) changes
              in the end-of-pipe treatment and pollutant generation coefficient
              were the dominant contributors to emissions reduction. The power
              and metal smelting sectors played important roles in SO2
              abatement, while the paper products and food products sectors
              were important in COD reduction; (ii) changes to the input
              coefficient increased overall emissions although there was a
              decrease in SO2 emissions in 2007-2010 mainly due to input
              structure improvements in the construction sector; (iii) the
              trade effect largely offset the domestic emission reduction
              effects, although the trade effect declined during the study
              period; (iv) domestic demand was the main factor increasing
              domestic emissions; domestic investment changes (especially in
              the construction sector) were the major contributor to increases
              in SO2 emissions, and final consumption changes (especially
              consumption in the food production sector) were the main
              contributor to the increase in COD emissions. The results yield

              reduction in energy consumption per unit of gross domestic
              product (GDP). With a dramatic reversal of this historic
              relationship, energy intensity increased 5\% per year during
              2002--2005. China's 11th Five Year Plan (FYP) set a target of
              reducing energy intensity by 20\% by 2010. This paper assesses
              selected policies and programs that China has instituted to
              fulfill the national goal, finding that China made substantial
              progress and many of the energy-efficiency programs appear to be

              the 11th FYP savings goals. China's appliance standards and

  abstract = "This paper presents theory and evidence from highly disaggregated
              Chinese data that tighter credit constrains force firms to
              produce lower quality. The paper modifies Melitz's (2003) model
              of trade with heterogeneous firms by introducing quality choice
              and credit constraints. The quality sorting model predicts that
              tighter credit constraints faced by a firm reduce its optimal
              prices due to its choice of lower-quality products. However, when
              quality cannot be chosen by a firm in an efficiency sorting
              model, there is an opposite prediction that prices increase as
              firms face tighter credit constraints. An empirical analysis

              Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC) and Chinese customs data
              strongly supports quality sorting and confirms the mechanism of
              quality adjustment: firms optimally choose to produce
              lower-quality products when facing tighter credit constraints.
              Moreover, the predictions of the efficiency sorting model are
              supported by using quality-adjusted prices in regression analysis

               effectiveness of environmental enforcement. It considers
               multiple dimensions of both enforcement and financial status.
               Regarding enforcement, the paper considers both the likelihood
               of enforcement, as captured by the likelihood of inspections
               conducted at regulated facilities, and the severity of
               enforcement, as captured by the size of sanctions imposed on
               polluting facilities found violating their effluent limits. As
               indicators of corporate financial status, the paper considers
               measures of liquidity, solvency, and profitability [a proxy for
               corporate managerial skill], all of which can influence the
               likelihood that a firm faces liquidity and/or bankruptcy
               constraints. The paper first develops a theoretical model of
               optimal abatement in the presence of liquidity and bankruptcy
               constraints and uses the model to investigate the impact of
               financial status on optimal abatement and the effectiveness of
               enforcement. Then the paper empirically examines the
               interactions between enforcement and financial status using data
               on wastewater discharges from US chemical manufacturing
               facilities for the years 1995 to 2001. Empirical results suggest
               that the financial status dimensions considered here in general
               play an important role in determining the incentives created by
               enforcement. As the most striking result, we show theoretically
               and empirically that, when financial dimensions are included in
               the analysis, the conventional wisdom regarding the effect of
               enforcement likelihood on abatement no longer holds, i.e.,
               increased enforcement can actually lead to worse environmental

  abstract={The Chinese state owned enterprises (SOEs) have become quite profitable recently. As the largest shareholder, the state has not asked SOEs to pay dividends in the past. Therefore, some have suggested that the state should ask SOEs to pay dividends. Indeed, the Chinese government has adopted this policy advice and started to demand dividend payment starting from 2008. While we do not question the soundness of the dividend policy, the point we raise is whether those profits are real if all costs owned by SOEs are properly accounted for. Among other things, we are interested in investigating whether the profits of SOEs would still be as large as they claim if they were to pay a market interest rate. Using a representative sample of corporate China, we find that the costs of financing for SOEs are significantly lower than for other companies after controlling for some fundamental factors for profitability and individual firm characteristics. In addition, our estimates show that if SOEs were to pay a market interest rate, their existing profits would be entirely wiped out. Our findings suggest that SOEs are still benefiting from credit subsidies and they are not yet subject to the market interest rates. In an environment where credit rights are not fully respected, dividend policy, though important, should come second and not first.},

  abstract = "At the center of the pollution haven debate is the claim that
              foreign investors from industrial countries are attracted to weak
              environment regulations in developing countries. Some recent
              location choice studies have found evidence of this attraction,
              but only for inward FDI in industrial countries. The few studies
              of inward FDI in developing countries have been hampered by weak
              measures of environmental stringency and by insufficient data to
              estimate variation in firm response by pollution intensity. This
              paper tests for pollution haven behavior by estimating the
              determinants of location choice for equity joint ventures (EJVs)
              in China. Beginning with a theoretical framework of firm
              production and abatement decisions, we derive and estimate a
              location choice model using data on a sample of EJV projects,
              Chinese effective levies on water pollution, and Chinese
              industrial pollution intensity. Results show EJVs in
              highly-polluting industries funded through Hong Kong, Macao, and
              Taiwan are attracted by weak environmental standards. In
              contrast, EJVs funded from non-ethnically Chinese sources are not
              significantly attracted by weak standards, regardless of the
              pollution intensity of the industry. These findings are
              consistent with pollution haven behavior, but not by investors
              from high income countries and only in industries that are highly
              polluting. Further investigation into differences in technology

              intensive pollutant emissions; (2) firms in regions with less
              local protection have lower pollution intensity; (3) better
              property rights protection is negatively correlated with
              pollutant discharge over and beyond the national standards; and
              (4) larger firms, firms in industries that export more, and firms
              with more educated employees pollute less. These results suggest
              that China should not target foreign firms more harshly in its
              effort to reduce industrial pollution. Better institutions in the
              form of more effective law enforcement and lower entry barriers

              with lax environmental regulation. While straightforward, the
              existing empirical literature is inconclusive owing to two
              shortcomings. First, unobserved heterogeneity and measurement
              error are typically ignored due to the lack of a credible,
              traditional instrumental variable for regulation. Second,
              geographic spillovers have not been adequately incorporated into

              regulation negatively impacts inbound foreign direct investment.

               foreign firms to pollute more or less than their host country

                 that multinational firms, particularly those engaged in highly
                 polluting activities, relocate to countries with weaker
                 environmental standards. Despite the plausibility and
                 popularity of this hypothesis, the existing literature has
                 found little evidence to support it. This paper identifies
                 four areas of difficulties that may have impeded the
                 researcher's ability to uncover this 'dirty secret.' This
                 includes the possibility that some features of FDI host
                 countries, such as bureaucratic corruption, may deter inward
                 FDI, but are positively correlated with laxity of
                 environmental standard. Omitting this information in
                 statistical analyses may give rise to misleading results.
                 Another potential problem is that country- or industry-level
                 data, typically used in the literature, may have masked the
                 effect at the firm level. In addition, environmental standard
                 of the host countries and pollution intensity of the
                 multinational firms are not easy to measure. This study
                 addresses these problems present in the earlier literature by
                 taking explicitly into account corruption level in host
                 countries and using a firm-level data set on investment
                 projects in 24 transition economies. With these improvements,
                 we find some support for the 'pollution haven' hypothesis, but

               allows me to examine previously unobserved economic outcomes
               such as nonemployment and long-run earnings losses from job
               transitions, both of which are critical to understanding the
               reallocative costs associated with these policies. Using
               plant-level panel variation induced by the 1990 Clean Air Act
               Amendments (CAAA), I find that the reallocative costs of

               plants experienced, in aggregate, more than \$5.4 billion in
               forgone earnings for the years after the change in policy. Most
               of these costs are driven by nonemployment and lower earnings in

               general equilibrium model to analyze the effect of credit
               constraints on production-generated pollution emissions. The
               model demonstrates that reducing credit constraints increases
               the scale of production (scale effect) and increases the number
               of firms taking up production (market size effect), while it
               also reduces emissions per unit of output (technique effect) and
               increases the share of firms investing in the technology upgrade

               plausibly confounding in nature, the net effect of credit
               constraints on pollution emissions is an empirical question.

              model wherein polluting firms borrow externally to finance
              investment in various assets, subject to a credit constraint. The
              main insight of the model is that credit constraints distort the
              composition of assets towards over-investment in tangible assets,
              which can be pledged as collateral, thereby increasing the

               function framework. Estimating the effects of regulation on
               productivity can be done with a top-down approach using data for
               broad sectors of the economy, or a more disaggregated bottom-up
               approach. Our study follows a bottom-up approach using data from
               the U.S. paper, steel, and oil industries. We measure
               environmental regulation using plant-level information on
               pollution abatement expenditures, which allows us to distinguish
               between productive and abatement expenditures on each input. We
               use annual Census Bureau information (1979-1990) on output,
               labor, capital, and material inputs, and pollution abatement
               operating costs and capital expenditures for 68 pulp and paper
               mills, 55 oil refineries, and 27 steel mills. We find that
               pollution abatement inputs generally contribute little or
               nothing to output, especially when compared to their
               {\^a}€˜productive{\^a}€™ equivalents. Adding an aggregate
               pollution abatement cost measure to a Cobb-Douglas production
               function, we find that a $1 increase in pollution abatement
               costs leads to an estimated productivity decline of $3.11,
               $1.80, and $5.98 in the paper, oil, and steel industries
               respectively. These findings imply substantial differences
               across industries in their sensitivity to pollution abatement
               costs, arguing for a bottom-up approach that can capture these
               differences. Further differentiating plants by their production
               technology, we find substantial differences in the impact of
               pollution abatement costs even within industries, with higher
               marginal costs at plants with more polluting technologies.
               Finally, in all three industries, plants concentrating on
               change-in-production-process abatement techniques have higher
               productivity than plants doing predominantly end-of-line
               abatement, but also seem to be more affected by pollution
               abatement operating costs. Overall, our results point to the
               importance using det(This abstract was borrowed from another

  abstract = "This paper investigates whether environmental regulation affects
              inbound foreign direct investment. The identification uses the
              Two Control Zones (TCZ) policy implemented by the Chinese
              government in 1998, in which tougher environmental regulations
              were imposed in TCZ cities but not others. Our
              difference-in-difference-in-differences estimation explores
              three-dimension variations; specifically, city (i.e., TCZ versus
              non-TCZ cities), industry (i.e., more polluting industries
              relative to less polluting ones), and year (i.e., before and
              after the TCZ policy). We find that tougher environmental
              regulation leads to less foreign direct investment. Meanwhile, we
              find that foreign multinationals from countries with better
              environmental protections than China are insensitive to the
              toughening environmental regulation, while those from countries
              with worse environmental protections than China show strong
              negative responses.",
